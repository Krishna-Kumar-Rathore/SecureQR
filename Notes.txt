Development Workflow:

Daily Development: Start backend → Start frontend
Testing Changes: Restart only the service you modified
Training Models: Run ML training when you have new data
Production: Build frontend → Deploy backend + frontend build

The key is always starting the backend first, as the frontend depends on the API being available.

**Backend First → Frontend Second → ML Training (Optional)**

The backend must run first because the frontend depends on it for API calls.

# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Install dependencies (if not done already)
npm installHere's the proper sequence and commands to run your SecureQR project:

## **Recommended Running Order:**

**Backend First → Frontend Second → ML Training (Optional)**

The backend must run first because the frontend depends on it for API calls.

## **Step-by-Step Commands:**

### **Step 1: Start Backend (Required)**
```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Install dependencies (if not done already)
npm install

# Start backend in development mode
npm run dev
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🚀 SecureQR Backend running on port 5000
🔒 Google Safe Browsing integration active
📡 API endpoints ready at http://localhost:5000/api
⚠️ No trained ML model found, using rule-based analysis
```

**Keep this terminal open and running.**

---

### **Step 2: Start Frontend (Required)**
Open a **new terminal** and run:

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies (if not done already)
npm install

# Start frontend development server
npm run dev
```

**Expected Output:**
```
VITE v7.1.6  ready in 590 ms
➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
➜  Network: use --host to expose
```

**Keep this terminal open too.**

---

### **Step 3: Test the Application**
1. Open your browser
2. Go to `http://localhost:5173`
3. You should see the SecureQR interface
4. Test with a sample URL like `https://google.com`

---

### **Step 4: ML Training (Optional)**
Only do this if you want to train custom models with your QR dataset.

Open a **third terminal** and run:

```bash
# Navigate to ml-training directory
cd ml-training

# Install Python dependencies (if not done already)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Process your QR dataset (if you have the dataset)
python process_qr_dataset_windows.py

# Train ML models (after processing is complete)
python train_model.py
```

**Note:** ML training will only work if you have the QR code dataset in `dataset/QR Codes/`.

---

## **Quick Start Script (All at Once)**

Create a `start.sh` script in your project root:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "🚀 Starting SecureQR Project..."

# Start backend in background
echo "📡 Starting Backend..."
cd backend && npm run dev &
BACKEND_PID=$!

# Wait for backend to start
sleep 5

# Start frontend in background
echo "🎨 Starting Frontend..."
cd ../frontend && npm run dev &
FRONTEND_PID=$!

echo "✅ Project started!"
echo "📡 Backend: http://localhost:5000"
echo "🎨 Frontend: http://localhost:5173"
echo ""
echo "Press Ctrl+C to stop all services"

# Wait for interrupt
trap "kill $BACKEND_PID $FRONTEND_PID" INT
wait
```

Then run:
```bash
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

---

## **Verification Steps:**

### **1. Check Backend Health**
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "message": "SecureQR Backend is running",
  "timestamp": "2024-..."
}
```

### **2. Test URL Analysis**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/check-url \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://google.com"}'
```

### **3. Frontend Access**
Visit `http://localhost:5173` and verify:
- Page loads without errors
- QR scanner interface appears
- Upload button works
- No console errors

---

## **Troubleshooting:**

**Backend won't start:**
- Ensure port 5000 is free
- Check Node.js version (18+)
- Verify .env file exists

**Frontend won't connect:**
- Ensure backend is running first
- Check for CORS errors in browser console
- Verify API URL in `frontend/src/utils/api.js`

**ML Training fails:**
- Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check if dataset exists in correct location
